ATTENTION="ATTENTION!
Your VPN server should never be directly connected to the Internet, otherwise the server is vulnerable and in the worst case offers direct access to your network.

In addition, you have to adjust your firewall under /usr/sbin/firewall.sh accordingly, so that the system is sufficiently protected.

To be always informed about errors in the system, I recommend to install \"logwatch\" and \"fail2ban\". You can find information about this on the internet."
